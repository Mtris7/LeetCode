1.How to store password in Database securely?
 - plan text but avoid, if we lost database
 - Encoding / encrypt password
 - hash password : sha256, sha512
 - hash + salt : 
 - hash + salt + pepper
 - slow hash + salt + pepper : bcrypt , scrypt
	

2.Symmetric vs Asymmetric encryption?
Symmetric : encrypt and decrypt with secure key 
Asymmetric : we have 2 pair of key : public key and primary key 
message is encrypted using a public key , we only decrypted message with primary key
message is encrypted using a primary key , we only decrypted message with public
slow

3.How RSA work?
we have 2 pair of key : public key and primary key 
c = encrypt(m, PK)

server send c with public key (PK) and 
m = decrypt(c, SK)
client get message with secure key (SK) 

4.How HTTPS work?

5.What happen during TLS Handshake?


6.Why use symmetric encryption for exchanging data instead of asymmetric encryption?
because it faster 

7.What is the use of client random and server random in TLS handshake?
 pre-master secret is a function use both client random and server random 

8.What is CORS?
is a mechanism to bypass SOP (same origin policy) : define which origin can request to server origin

9.How to prevent SQL injection?
prepare statement

10.How do you implement authentication?


//validate : signature : hash(encode(header) + encode(payload) + secret key)

11.How JWT work? Pros & Cons? How to revoke JWT from server?
JWT : client send id and password
 server validate and generate token with secret key
 client send request with token in a header
 server validate token with secret key and return response

 Pros & Cons:


12.2 users in diff location login with same JWT, how to warn user?
13.Access token vs Refresh token
Access token is a secure string that client uses to access protected resources
refresh token is a credential that client uses to obtain new access token
